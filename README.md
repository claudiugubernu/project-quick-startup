# Project Quick Startup

A quick project startup that enables you to run a local server that will update every time a change is detected ( cmd + S / ctrl + S ) that also compiles SASS into css.
It comes with a folder structure in place which makes it even more easier to utilise.


## Installation

Clone the repo or download the .zip and add to your project

Install NPM

```bash
npm install
```

## Running commands

To compile once sass into css simply run: 

```bash
npm run sass-build
```

To compile continuously sass into css simply run: 

```bash
npm run styles:watch
```

To start the local server, sass compiling and js watch simply run: 

```bash
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
